You will need to install the following:
1. Google Chrome (if you don't already have it) - https://www.google.com/chrome/
2. ChromeDriver - https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
    - NOTE: if you are on Chrome version 115 or higher, you will need to find the correct ChromeDriver in the chrome-for-testing 
            area of the website: https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing/
    - This download is just an executable. I put the chromedriver.exe files in the following location: "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe". If you put yours elsewhere, you
      will need to update this path in the places marked in the python web scraper files.
3. Selenium - install via pip in virtual environment with command "pip install Selenium"
